### Developing high-performance C++ algorithms

**Type:** Breakout session *(other options: Workshop, Half-day workshop)*

**Speaker:** [Sasha Goldshtein](https://github.com/selagroup/sdp-dec2016-cfp/issues/1)

**Technical level:** Intermediate

**Abstract:** In this talk you will learn how to build fast, robust, portable, and efficient libraries that implement popular algorithms in C++, ranging from simple collection primitives such as `binary_search` and all the way to graph traversal and game theory. This session is packed with practical examples that use design ideas from Boost and the C++ STL to implement practical algorithm collections.

**Prerequisites:** C++ development experience, including good familiarity with templates.

**Hardware/Software Requirements:** None

**Audio/Video Requirements:** None
