## Sela Developer Practice December 2016 -- Call for Papers

[Sela Developer Practice](http://www.seladeveloperpractice.com) is Israel's largest conference for software developers and IT professionals. Since the first SDP in 2009, the conference kept growing -- we now have two SDPs every year, with more than 3,000 attendees.

This year, we're running our Call for Papers on GitHub: you can submit your talk ideas, review existing submissions, comment and discuss with your fellow speakers and attendees, and update your submission as necessary.

### CFP Deadline

**The CFP is open until August 15, 2016.** However, you are encouraged to submit talks as soon as possible, so that we can start putting the agenda together. Your talks might be confirmed before the CFP closes. Under extraordinary circumstances, we might be able to accept submissions past the CFP deadline.

International speakers are requested to deliver a workshop; compensation for the workshop will be determined according to the number of attendees who sign up. Additional details on the compensation structure will be provided to selected speakers.

#### Speaker Notification

Speakers will be notified at least 3 months before the conference. The earlier you submit, the earlier we might be able to confirm your sessions, even before the CFP closes.

#### Speaker Obligations

Speakers will be required to perform a dry run of their sessions in person or online, several weeks prior to the conference. At that time, you will also be expected to have the final version of your slides and hands-on labs available. We print the slides for workshop attendees, which is why you will be requested to send them to us in advance. More details will be provided in the speaker contract that you'll sign if your session is accepted.

#### Organization Team

The conference content chair is Sasha Goldshtein, CTO of Sela Group. You can reach him via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/goldshtn) or [email](mailto:sashag@sela.co.il).

You will also be working with Mali Greenberg, who is in charge of the event logistics, and Michal Shachaf-Ofek, who is responsible for international speakers' travel and accommodation.

#### Code of Conduct

The conference [Code of Conduct](coc.md) applies to the call for papers process as well. Content or comments that violate our CoC will be deleted.

### How To Submit

Inspired by many other conferences who are running their CFP on GitHub, we decided to launch our CFP in the open. The open format helps us and prospective speakers keep track of the submissions and allows attendees to participate and comment on your submissions. Definitely feel free to take a look around before and after submitting your own talks. Additionally, GitHub issues are editable -- so you can always come back and tweak your submission if necessary.

#### Steps to Submit
